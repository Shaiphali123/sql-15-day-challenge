   Git is the version control tool. GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket are platforms for hosting Git repositories with additional collaboration features.

3. **What is the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?**  
   `git pull` fetches and merges changes from the remote.  
   `git fetch` only downloads changes without merging.

4. **What does `git status` do?**  
   It shows the current state of the working directory and staging area.

5. **How do you clone a repository?**

   * `merge` keeps the history as is and adds a merge commit.
   * `rebase` rewrites history for a linear flow.

3. **How do you resolve merge conflicts?**
   Manually edit conflicting files, then run:

   ```bash
   git add <file>
   git commit
   ```

4. **How do you undo a commit?**

   * To modify the last commit: `git commit --amend`
   * To undo and keep changes: `git reset --soft HEAD~1`
   * To undo and discard changes: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`

5. **What is `git stash` used for?**
   Temporarily shelves changes so you can work on something else.

## ðŸ”¹ Advanced Git Topics

1. **Explain `git cherry-pick`.**
   Applies the changes introduced by an existing commit onto the current branch.

2. **Difference between `git reset`, `git revert`, and `git checkout`?**

   * `reset`: Moves HEAD and changes history
   * `revert`: Creates a new commit to undo a previous one
   * `checkout`: Switches branches or restores files

3. **What is a Git tag?**
   Tags mark specific points in history, usually for releases.

4. **Explain a branching strategy youâ€™ve used.**
   Example: Git Flow, Feature Branching, or Trunk-Based Development.

5. **What are hooks in Git?**
   Scripts that run before/after Git events like commit, push, etc.

   Using Pull Requests (PRs) with reviewer assignments and automated checks.
