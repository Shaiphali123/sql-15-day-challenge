# üìÖ Day 14: SQL Performance Tips

Welcome to **Day 14** of the SQL 15-Day Challenge!  
Today we focus on **SQL performance tuning** ‚Äì how to write fast, efficient queries that scale well with growing data.

## ‚ö° Why SQL Performance Matters?

Poorly written queries can:
- Slow down your app
- Lock tables
- Drain server resources
- Impact customer experience

Learning to **optimize SQL** is a crucial skill for any backend or data engineer.

## üîç Top SQL Performance Tips

### 1. ‚úÖ Use SELECT Only What You Need
```sql
-- Avoid this
SELECT * FROM Employees;

-- Do this
SELECT name, salary FROM Employees;
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Use WHERE to Filter Early
```sql
SELECT name FROM Employees WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Use Proper Indexes
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_department ON Employees(department);
```

### 4. ‚úÖ Avoid Using Functions on Indexed Columns
```sql
-- This disables index:
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE YEAR(joining_date) = 2023;

-- Instead:
SELECT * FROM Employees 
WHERE joining_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
```

### 5. ‚úÖ Use EXPLAIN/EXPLAIN PLAN
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT name FROM Employees WHERE department = 'HR';
```

### 6. ‚úÖ Avoid DISTINCT If Not Needed

### 7. ‚úÖ Use JOINs Efficiently

### 8. ‚úÖ LIMIT Large Results
```sql
SELECT * FROM Sales ORDER BY amount DESC LIMIT 100;
```

### 9. ‚úÖ Normalize Data, but Not Too Much

### 10. ‚úÖ Clean & Archive Old Data

## üíº Real-world Scenario

> üîÑ You‚Äôre running a report that takes 12 seconds to load.  
> ‚û§ Use `EXPLAIN`, add index on `report_date`, and fetch only necessary columns.  
> ‚è± Query now takes 1.2 seconds!

## üß™ Practice Problem

üß© **Problem:**  
You have a table `Orders(order_id, customer_id, order_date, amount)`.  
Write an optimized query to get the top 5 customers by total order value in 2024.

<details>
<summary>üí° Click to view the solution</summary>

```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM Orders
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
</details>

## üß† Advanced SQL Performance Tips

### 11. Use EXISTS Instead of IN
```sql
SELECT name FROM Employees e
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM Departments d 
  WHERE d.location = 'NY' AND d.id = e.department_id
);
```

### 12. Avoid OR in WHERE Clause
```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders 
WHERE status IN ('Pending', 'Processing');
```

### 13. Avoid SELECT in Loops

### 14. Be Cautious with CTEs

## üìÅ Case Study: Dashboard Query

```sql
-- Original (slow)
SELECT * FROM Sales WHERE YEAR(sale_date) = 2024 AND region = 'Asia';

-- Optimized (fast)
SELECT * FROM Sales 
WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31' AND region = 'Asia';
```
